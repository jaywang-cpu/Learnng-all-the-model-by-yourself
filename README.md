# Learnng-all-the-model-by-yourself

## The reason of creating this repo 
I am a beginner in machine learning, deep learning, and other algorithms, but I am confident in mastering them well. I have developed a comprehensive learning plan that consists of two main parts: necessary tools and different algorithms.For the necessary tools, there are many available options, and I plan to learn from their official websites. To maximize my time efficiency, I will follow the **80/20 principle - spending 80% of my time on the 20% most important concepts**, while learning other topics only when needed.For algorithms, I will apply the same approach: maximizing the benefit of my time by focusing on the most vital 20% of content and **learning from open-source coding resources shared by GitHub contributors**.
