# Decision Tree

## Definition 
Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a tree-like model of decisions to predict target values through recursiveï¼ˆé€’è¿›çš„ï¼‰ binary splitting. 
Just like a doctor's diagnosis: step by step narrowing down the possibilities based on symptoms to reach a final diagnosis! ðŸŒ³

* leaf node: four pie charts
* parent node: Expression correlation>0.9
* children nodeï¼šthose in the middle

## How to evalute it 
### 1. Entropy
#### Defintion
we use entropy to quantify the similarity or difference in the node, stands for the chaosity within the node, more close to 0 more close to purity, 1 means half-half possibility which have the most impurity.
